Customizing the web UI
######################

There is currently no pluggable way of customizing the web UI apart from the settings available in
:ref:`swagger-ui-settings` and :ref:`redoc-ui-settings`. If you really need to, you can override one of the
``drf-swagger/swagger-ui.html`` or ``drf-swagger/redoc.html`` templates that are used for rendering.
